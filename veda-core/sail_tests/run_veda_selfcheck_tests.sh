# tests. Mirrors this project's own real rtl/run_act4_tests.sh pattern
# (assemble, link, run, collect PASS/FAIL, print a summary table) but
# targets sail_riscv_sim directly instead of the RTL testbench, using
# sail_riscv_sim's own real, built-in HTIF support (confirmed working
# this pass: "SUCCESS"/exit 0 on tohost=1, "FAILURE"/exit 1 on tohost=3)
# rather than a custom watcher.
