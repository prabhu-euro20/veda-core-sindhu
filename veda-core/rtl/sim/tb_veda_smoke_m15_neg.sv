// Veda-Core RTL Milestone 15 negative control: proves the real bug this
// milestone fixes (ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENT_FINDINGS.md Finding 1) is
// genuinely closed. Object_ID=32 and Object_ID=288 (32+256) alias onto
// the same physical ODT slot under the RTL's 256-entry, low-8-bit-index
// scheme; before this milestone, a fresh Bind for Object_ID=32 issued
// after Object_ID=288 was populated silently resolved to Object_ID=288's
// own object instead (empirically reproduced before any fix was
// designed). This test proves it now hard-traps instead. See
// veda_smoke_m15_neg.S for the full step-by-step proof structure.
