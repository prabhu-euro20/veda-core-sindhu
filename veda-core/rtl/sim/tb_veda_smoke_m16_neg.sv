// Veda-Core RTL Milestone 16 negative control: proves the real bug this
// milestone fixes (ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENT_FINDINGS.md Finding 2) is
// genuinely closed. Destroying the same Object_ID 256 times wraps the
// RTL's 8-bit generation counter exactly back to a stale capability's own
// cached value; before this milestone, a subsequent re-populate let that
// stale capability keep dereferencing memory it should have lost access
// to at the very first Destroy (empirically reproduced before any fix
// was designed). This test proves the slot is now permanently retired
// instead. See veda_smoke_m16_neg.S for the full step-by-step proof
// structure.
